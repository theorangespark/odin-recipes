        <li>Mix warm milk together with yeast. Sift flour into the mixture after 10-15 minutes.. Add salt, oil and knead dough.</li>
        <li>When it is ready cover dough with towel and leave in warm place to rise. Grate cheese and mix with one egg.</li>
        <li>Split filling in balls, each 300 g. When dough rises separate in 300g balls as well.

        <li>Place khachapuri on baking tray, brush with yolk and milk mixture and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes at medium heat.
